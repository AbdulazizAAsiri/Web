bitmaps vs vectors. 

JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a type of image format known as bitmap.

Some facts:
JPEG at 300 dpi = 1,526kb
JPEG at 72 ppi = 368kb


Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.


Animated GIF: Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
